# Music <--> Graph
Music to Graph is an application that allows you to do two things:
  1) Input a .wav file and view the audio data contained within in a graph format (Graph --> Music)
  
  -- and --
  
  2) Input a algebraic expression and generate the graph of that expression, as well as an audible format of the function (Music --> Graph)

# Download & Usage
As of now, only the deskop app is available. You can download that from the release folder inside the main MusicToGraph folder, or use the link [here](https://github.com/Scoutdrago3/MusicToGraph/raw/master/MusicToGraph/release/music-to-graph-v1.0.jar). This application requires Java to be installed on your computer, and will run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

# Plans
Here is a list of features I'd like to implement down the line:
  1) sigma function
  2) effective default graph zoom/focus
  3) better audio exprience (a bug exists in the Java sound library)
  4) build a more attractive UI
  6) create a follow along feature, showing what the pars of the graph sound like
